        <p><em>Web Developer in the Making</em></p>
        <p>I am a 19 year old woman from Seattle that was raised without a clue as to what financial
          stability looked like. I was living in proverty most of my childhood, and moving in
          with my grandmother at age 14 was the closest I ever got to getting out of it.
          I recently moved out of my Grandma's house and into my first apartment.
          Over the past year, I couldn't help but worry about what I was going to do
          with my life. I felt that I had no valuable skills, and while I was eager to
          learn, I couldn't figure out where to start. I kept coming up with all kinds of
          career paths
          that I was interested in, but nothing stuck, and I never took action.
          This all changed when I met my friend Rozey. Rozey was the first person
          to take the time to give me really valuable advice. He made me believe that I had a
          chance. He provided me with the resources I needed to get started, I told my
          Grandma all about it, and she purchased <a

              Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu</em></a> for me. This $119 purchase changed my life.
          I immediately began to enjoy coding and everything that came with Web Development.
          That's when I knew I was on the path to a job that not only would I enjoy,
          but would provide me financial freedom, something that I've never experienced
          before. <br></p>
